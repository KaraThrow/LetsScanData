User Instructions-
Things to note: I did not make a website (sorry)

--- Step 1 (optional) ---
Run JSONtoCSV.py to extract the information from
yelp_academic_dataset_business.json and
yelp_academic_dataset_review.json

This takes forever and there might be some errors
(I think I had to change 1 or 2 entries)
so the alternative is to just use the review.csv 
and business.csv that are provided


--- Step 2 (optional) ---
Run sample.py to generate sample.csv, which contains
a randomly generated list of business ID's which
are used as the training data. Changing the value of
'samplefraction' variable will increase or decrease the 
sample size. 

You also have the option of just using the sample.csv provided


--- Step 3 ---
First, run Main.py.
After it finishes running you can input some function calls to make it do stuff.
train() - this functions uses the training data to build a simple decision tree.
		  After calling this function, all classifications will be attempted with the tree. 
testsample() - this attempts to classify all the training data
testdata(x) - this attempts to classify the first x businesses in the business hashtable
bidquery(bid) - this attempts to classify the business that corresponds to the business id
